# Advent of Code Solutions

Welcome to my repository for the daily problems from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)! This repository contains my solutions to the challenges presented each year.

## Overview

Advent of Code is an annual event that offers a series of programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. Each day, a new problem is released, and participants can submit their solutions in any programming language they choose.

## Solutions

In this repository, you will find my solutions to the daily problems. Most of these solutions are implemented using brute-force methods. While brute-force approaches can be straightforward and easy to understand, they may not always be the most efficient. However, they serve as a great way to grasp the problem and explore different aspects of programming.

### Brute-Force Solutions

- **Simplicity**: Brute-force solutions are often easier to implement and understand, making them a good starting point for tackling complex problems.
- **Exploration**: These solutions allow for exploration of the problem space, helping to identify patterns and potential optimizations.
- **Learning**: Working through brute-force methods can enhance problem-solving skills and deepen understanding of algorithms and data structures.
